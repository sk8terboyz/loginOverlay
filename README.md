# loginOverlay

This is a simple login overlay when the button is clicked. The overlay fades in and animates from the top creating a username and password text field. Currently it is a hard code check for username: "AA" and password: "a". This was done for simple testing purposes. This project is not one that I plan to expand further, rather this was a testing ground and I am keeping this for later use.
